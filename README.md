# Showlodex/ConcertVAULT

## USER Story

You and a friend are talking about the best concerts you’ve ever been to. You remember who you saw, but when was it? What did they play? Now with ConcertVAULT you can memorialize all your concert memories in one place. 

## Landing Page

From the homepage the USER can simply search for their favorite concert, venue, or artist and see a list of all those concerts. From there they can choose to signup for the service and begin creating their VAULT of concert memories. 

## Account Creation Page

USER will be shown a screen with two fields to fill out, USERname and Password. These fields will be validated and shown errors if requirements are not met. Once a USER is ready to proceed with the account creation they will click on the submit button. The USER can also cancel out of the form and return to the homepage.

## Profile Page

The USER will then be taken to the profile page. There they will see their avatar, their USERname and date joined, list of concerts, a map, and a button to add concerts. The nav bar will have a home field and logout button. 

## Add Concert Page

The USER will be shown a form with fields to fill out to remember their concert. The fields will be date, venue, weather, concert buddies. The USER will push the “press play” button to submit that concert. The USER will also be able to navigate to the landing screen or logout. This information will now appear on the profile page and a pin will now drop on the map showing the location.
